This folder contains just a small collection of CV templates that are publicly available on the internet. There are 3 main examples. 
(1) cv-us.tex is a basic example with a typical academic CV layout. It provides a good baseline for seeing how to define new environments, and is good practice using more advanced font encoding with different TeX engines.

(2) cv_template_xetex_fontin.tex is another example, again with advanced font options (to set different roman, sans serif, etc. fonts and ligatures)

(3) res2.tex is one final example that features an external font style file as well as a separate class file. Keep in mind that these two documents must be stored in the same folder as your .tex file for your CV to compile with the correct style referents.
