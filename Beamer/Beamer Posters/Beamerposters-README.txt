Beamer is a great way to make posters for PolMeth, MLE class, or other venues.

This folder contains a pretty minimum working example of a poster made using Beamer. There are a few other things in this folder to take note of:

(1) all of the .png and .pdf files are pulled into the poster as figures
(2) There are several .sty files in this folder. You can modify which one the poster references using the arguments in line 2 of the beamer poster. Play around and see which you like best. Also note that you can edit these .sty files to make changes to the colors and shapes inside your beamer poster.
(3) One exception is the tangocolors.sty file, which is simply creating a series of colors that you might want to use *inside* the other .sty files
